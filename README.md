# CitySaVer!
## Listing the trips where using the MTR City Saver actually saves.

A quick project I have wanted to do for around 5 months.

Taking ~1 hour of my time (from around 2025-06-14 22:20 to 23:20 HKT), this Python script inspects the trips that are in the `mtr_lines_fares.csv` provided by https://www.data.gov.hk and check the trips that has the Octopus adult fare higher than (or equal to, for some reasons) the average fare of the MTR City Saver ($460 / 40 trips).
